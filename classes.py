'''
All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.

Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:
'''
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
  def __str__(self):
    return f"{self.name}({self.age})"
p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)
#print without string and with string  function
print(p1)
